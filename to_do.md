# Still To Do  

* ~~finish indices function~~
* ~~rewrite date formatting and functionality to include time~~
* ~~fix html issues with indices~~
* ~~rewrite function for creating individual html files, need to change the header rows to be more like the index file. probably need to fix indices first~~
* ~~add links to posts on indices (post and author should be easy, tags might have to come later)~~
* ~~add functionality to check if folder exists, create it if it doesn't~~
  * ~~done for major folders, need to figure out how to handle on file creation for posts, specifically for years~~
* fix index.html link for other files
* add about link to footer
* add site icon (need name first?)
* add site title to header and config.json

# Still To Do  

* ~~finish indices function~~
* ~~rewrite date formatting and functionality to include time~~
* ~~fix html issues with indices~~
* ~~rewrite function for creating individual html files, need to change the header rows to be more like the index file. probably need to fix indices first~~
* ~~add links to posts on indices (post and author should be easy, tags might have to come later)~~
* ~~add functionality to check if folder exists, create it if it doesn't~~
  * ~~done for major folders, need to figure out how to handle on file creation for posts, specifically for years~~
* ~~fix index.html link for other files~~
* ~~add about link to footer~~
* ~~add site icon (need name first?)~~
* ~~add site title to header and config.json~~
* need to make some improvements to the overall look of the blog html
* index pagination? (not at release, not sure how to handle)
* a sidebar would be great, with a link to the individual author and tag pages and the about page (not at release, not sure how to handle)
* should I build .exe and .whateverlinuxuses files to ease usage? (py-builder?)
* need to fix the templates folder and functionality to make adding user created templates easier
